        <h1>About The Game</h1>
		<p1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Defense is the first game to ever be developed by Procrastination software. &nbsp;We are a development team based in Towson, MD made up of undergraduate students looking to break into the gaming industry with a bang. Wall defense was developed in under 6 months from conception to initial release. As the first game in what is hopefully a long list of titles coming from this company. It was a real learning experience for all of us as for may of us it was our first time in a software development team. This game takes a lot of its inspiration from other popular indie games including Geometry Wars and Super Hexagon. It has changed drastically from our original sketch.
